== Description ==
Femina is my first WordPress theme, written with love for simple code. It was designed to be fully responsive by taking the mobile-first approach. Besides a very customizable header, it features the full range of post formats, three menu locations, two widget areas in the sidebar and three in the footer. It is accessibility and translation ready and has full Gutenberg support.

* Mobile-first, Responsive Layout
